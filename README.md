# Blogging Platform API

RESTful API project for a blogging platform. See each directory for specific information.

## Description
This project was meant to practice making RESTful API. I utilized NodeJS and ExpressJS to build the backend. The API lets you perform CRUD operations for posts (blogs). You can for example:

- Create a post
- Retrieve all posts from database
- Update an existing post
- Delete an existing post

Along with this, I have alos implemented a wildcard full text search which lets you search for posts in the database.

## Goals
The goals of this project are to help me:

- Understand what the RESTful APIs are including best practices and conventions
- Learn how to create a RESTful API
- Learn about common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Learn about status codes and error handling in APIs
- Learn how to perform CRUD operations using an API
- Learn how to work with databases

## Tech Stack

- NodeJS and ExpressJS for backend. 
- MongoDB as my database storage.
